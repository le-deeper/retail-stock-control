## Features that can be added
### Personalization
> A page for customizing the various elements of the site that can be added, such as the possibility of changing the

### Notifications
> A reminder of actions not yet seen by the main manager can be added

### Database and /admin/
> Buttons on the main page can be added for creating and deleting different table 
> instances to dissociate from the /admin/ page.

### Factoring
> Files such as index_script.js can be factorized.

### Security
> The application can be made more secure by adding a captcha to the login page, or by adding a two-factor authentication.
> In addition, you need to ensure that sensitive javascript code is not accessible from simple manager requests (
> for example, the code of a js function that allows you to add a manager, even if the latter can't execute this function anyway because he lacks privileges).
